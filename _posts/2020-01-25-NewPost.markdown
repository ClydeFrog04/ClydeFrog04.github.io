**Update**
=============================================

**PAGE IN PROGRESS. Probably never to be finished**

It has been a long time since I have updated anything on this site. I will most likely never be posting here again. I started this website as a way to learn web development, and while it was a a ton of fun making and designing this site, it is wildly out of date. This framework was most likely old and outdated when I started this site, but it was relatively easy to use, and more importantly very fast to use. I got this entire site done in a day or two. While it isn't overly impressive, it is functional. I will soon be learning a much more useful and up to date(for now) framework and be making a new site to share my projects on. I'll be learning react development with python backend, which will give me a lot more options for design and more control of the functionality of my site over jekyll.
