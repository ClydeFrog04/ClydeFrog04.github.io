How to change your eye color in Photoshop
=========================================

1. Open Photoshop
2. Open picture of eye you'd like to change the color of.
* If you do not have a picture of an eye to use, you can download the same one I'll be using <a href="/Images/eyeToRecolor.jpg" download="EyePicture">here. </a> 
        *Note- this picture is not my own, I am using it within the fair use license. The original comes from <a href="https://www.rdmag.com/article/2017/02/new-research-shows-zika-can-damage-eyes" target="_blank">this article.</a>
3. Create a layer mask
4. Draw a mask around the portion of eye you'd like to recolor
* Anything in black on the mask will not be included, anything in white will be included on the recoloring.
5. Add an adjustment layer
* Adding a curves adjustment layer will be the easiest way for a beginner to recolor their eyes. After the layer is added, you simply drag the adjustment handle in the curves adjustment settings, and you should see your eye changing color.
* You can also change your eye color and other aspects of your eye using any of the other adjustment layers. Try them out and see how they affect your eye.
