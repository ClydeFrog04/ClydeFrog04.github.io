This website is currently a work in progress. It will eventually be a place for me to share all of my work with the world, future employers, friends and anyone else who may be interested in what I do. If you have any suggestions for me for work or improvements I can make to this website, please send me an email at the email acount below!

I am currently a Computer Science student with a focus on game design. I recently finished my first 2D game and am currently working on a 3D game. My preferred game engine is Unity. I also have experience writing programs in many other languages such as Java, c++, c#, javascript, Actionscript, Python and Papyrus.
